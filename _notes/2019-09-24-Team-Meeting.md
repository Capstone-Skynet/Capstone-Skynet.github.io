## Agenda

### General

- Weekend readings?
- To-do tasks will be listed in backlog (put everything that we potentially need to do in *backlog*)
- Every Tuesday meeting we will triage the backlog tasks (assuming that previous sprint’s tasks/cards have been completed)
  - Assign members
  - Assign due date
  - Assign priority

### Risks

- Gather potential risks
- Create matrix

### Proposal Document

- Due Tuesday October 15th
- Create outline document
- LaTeX

### Elephant in the room - Mieszko not in the room

- Briefly go over the agenda for client meeting.



## List of Risks

- FPGA logic capacity is not enough to implement our solution.
- Electronics and batter makes it too heavy for the drone to take off.
- Drone cannot take off at all due to drone hardware failure.
- The final product cannot be maintained or extended.
- Client is not available enough to provide significant help.
- Development environment is inadequate.
- Software license does not allow our application to be delivered.
- Equipment shipment is delayed or lost.
- Illegal to fly drone.
- Knowledge and skill (Machine Learning & Computer vision) required for project is not sufficient.
- Not enough time commitment from team member due to other courses.
- Camera doesn’t work with FPGA
- FPGA doesn’t work with transmission systems
- Machine learning resources lack documentation
- Camera lack documentation
- FPGA lack documentation
- Client becoming hostile
- Our scrum method is not efficient
- :angry: Muchen becomes hostile
- Peter become hostile
- Ardell becomes hostile
- Arthur becomes hostile
- Wilson becomes hostile
- Team is indecisive which leads to delay - management is not good enough to make a timely decision.
- Team has lack of communication and make assumptions which leads to incompatibility
- Documentation is not specific / complete.
- Not enough time to work on documentation.
- Loss of team member
- Loss of client
- Selected software methodology creates issues with team member that decreases productivity
- Sabotage
- Accidents that damage to drone and FPGA that leads to extra budget that we may not have.
- New technology or research that changes the scope significantly
- Legal changes significantly affect project - drones in particular
- Deliveries is not meeting client’s expectations
- Not have enough money.
- Forced to buy cheaper components which leads to lower performance.
- Scope of the project is underestimated which leads to burn outs
- Scope of the project is overestimated which leads to diversification of vision of the project.
- Competitive offerings affect project requirement
- Client wants to modify scope and requirements that leads to delays or cut features.
- Technical debt paydown impact project timeline.
- Delivered documentation not adequate for usage and upgrade.
- Key hardware components not available
- Not enough machine learning training data.
