## Heading 2

This is a testing note. The document is written in Markdown and then statically generated into HTMl using Jekyll. The notetaker will take notes in Markdown and this is where the notes are archived. Since it is rendered to a webpage, it is easily accessible (even via mobile).

In the front matter (stuff surrounded by `---`), add the line `use_math: true` to enable MathJax in webpages to render LaTeX math.

## Another Heading 2

All Markdown syntax is supported. Including code blocks:

```python

def foo(do, da):
    print(f'{do} bar {da}')
    return do + da
```

> And block quotes
