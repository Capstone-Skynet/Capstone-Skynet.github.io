## Risk Management

### Potential Risk Candidates

- Take a look at the list of 50 potential risks (as inspiration) before having the client meeting.
- Formulate judgement on potential risk.

### CPEN 421 Risk Management Slide Deck

- Go through the slide deck.
- Risk index = Risk impact &times; probability
- Sort the risk by category and then by risk index. Draw a line / threshold: we need to actively mitigate the risk for risks above the line.

## First Client Meeting

The doucment conatains potential agenda items for the first-client meeting.

Most significasntly: “Substance focus for today”. It’s strongly recommended to understand client’s high level business goals. We have a duty of informing the client of potential opportunities, but that require the understanding of the high level goals first.

Limit discussion to high-level to keep the meetings short. Almost no design or validation details. But we do need to communicate **constraints** such as budget.

## Indicative Document

We will be producing some artifacts/deliverables:

- Proposal (due early October) - the document outlines the suggested outline for the proposal.
- The highlighted green-stuff is specifically for the first proposal or a signed contract.
- Legacy document: specification to how to operate, maintain, and upgrade project (to survive the team’s departure once the project is done).



## Machine Learning Steps

`refer to Google drive document`

The main point is to get a set of clean data – by that we mean data with minimal internal correlation. 

Data-science references on potential pitfalls is upcoming.

## Project Management

- Recommended **1 week** sprint
