## Who are we?

We are University of British Columbia ECE Capstone 2019-2020 Team 109. 

## What do we do?

Our project is is to verify the validity of highly mobile machine-learning computing platform using FPGA as hardware accelerator. The FPGA will accelerate a particular machine learning model taylored to the clients' applications. The whole system will integrate onto a drone for its protability. We are exploring image classification and object recognition as a sample ML model for testing.
