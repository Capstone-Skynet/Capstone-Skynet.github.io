# Slide points

Viability
- Goal is to assess system feasibility of 3 main objectives
- Individual componenets of the project exists already
  - FPGA-drone: flight controls
  - Data transmission: flight communications
  - ML-FPGA: Up and coming research
- Ultimately further this field of research
- Project is a proof-of-concept



# 'Script'

Our project is an integration of the three objectives mentioned
previously, and assesses the feasibility of a system that incorporates all the componenets. 

If we look at the three objectives individually, theyre all technologies
that been explored or developed.

For integration of FGPA hardware with a drone, general purpose 
FPGA platforms, according to our research, do not exist but ones for specific
applications like flight controls (UAVs) do.

For air-to-ground data transmission, there are many many technologies that use this including
radio transmissions, GPS systems, flight communications.

For Machine Learning Implementation on FPGAs is becoming a prominent field
of research (as seen with the MARLANN ML accelerator, and research papers we referenced when reseraching about the topic)

So, our project is not entirely a new technology (or area being explored), rather more of an integration of multiple components.

Ultimately, our project has the potential to advance research in the area of ML models being
implemented on dedicated hardware.

The client has also stated that this project is proof-of-concept, so it is possible full integration of the three components may not be possible. However, based on our research and planning, this most likely wont be the case.
