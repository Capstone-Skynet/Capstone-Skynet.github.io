# What are the risks

Due to limited time and budget, we are carefully considering all risks of the project. The top risks is in 3 categories: **management risks**, **hardware risks**, **software risks**, and **legacy risks**.

# How we manage risks

We use a risk profile table.

Each week the matrix is updated: new potential risks is added to the matrix along with their likelihood and impact. We carefully consider these metrics as it will affect how much effort we are putting in into strategies to mitigate the risks with high severity.

If the risk index is greater than 0.4, we will actively follow the risk mitigation protocol: which involves triaging tasks related to mitigate the risk on Trello.

Risk index less than 0.4 are monitored, but not actively mitigated due to time constraints.

For each of the aforementioned categories of risks, there are their own risk mitigation overall strategies:

# Hardware Risks

We ranked risks involving drones as highest priority because the hardware is very fragile. A single crash of the drone could result in total loss --- with little chance of receiving extra budget.

**Management:**

We are actively trying to mitigate these risks by:

Safety protocol such as only attaching the propellers to the drone as the last task when the drone absolutely ready for take off is an example that must be followed every time.

# Management Risks

Management risks include non-technical risks such as team management, time management, and development methodology risks.

The top most risk is not enough time contributed by teammates, with uniform work contributed.

**Management:**

Clear and effective communication and management strategies such as weekly standups, WSRs, and scrum boards are used to manage these risks

# Legacy Risks

Because the proejc tis to be used for the long term by the client for research and development. We want to make sure the the project deliverable has acceptable longevity.

What if certain part on the drone require maintenance or replacement?

What if the radio or the transmitter doesn't work

What if X doesn't work?
What if Y breaks?

**Management:**

We will mitigate by actively updating the specification documents, operation manual, etc.

We will **not** leave these document as a last-minute consideration. These documents are to be updated in parallel as we continue with our development.

# Software Risks

Lowest risk in terms of severity to the project. Because 

1. The software / netlist is not the top priority in terms of requirement for the client
2. Software has workarounds that is much easier than hardware or other risks
3. Software is cheap

**Management:**

Use version tracking and code review.

Consult client, experts, or the internet
