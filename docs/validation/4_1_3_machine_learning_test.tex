\paragraph{\underline{T.ML.1: ML Results Test}}

This test verifies the correctness of the ML results.

\textbf{Addresses}: F.HL.2, F.ML.1

\textbf{Procedure}:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Prepare a test video with pre-labelled results.
    \item Feed the test video to the machine learning model.
    \item Record the results from the machine learning model.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Verification}: 
Verify that the ML results match with the pre-labelled results.

\paragraph{\underline{T.ML.2: ML Latency Test}}

This test checks if the latency of the machine learning model is acceptable.

\textbf{Addresses}: F.ML.3

\textbf{Procedure}:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Write a program to record the timestamp for each processed frame received on the PMB.
    \item Calculate the timing gaps between 100 consecutive frames.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Verification}: 
Confirm that there are no frame gaps greater than one second.
