\paragraph{T.ML.1: ML Results Test}

This test verifies the correctness of the ML results.

\textbf{Addresses}: F.ML.1

\textbf{Procedure}:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Prepare a set of testing frames with prelabelled results.
    \item Feed the testing set to the machine learning model.
    \item Record the results from the machine learning model.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Verification}: 
Verify the ML results with prelabelled results. If the overall correctness of the ML results is higher than 80\%, this test is passed.

\paragraph{T.ML.2: ML Latency Test}

This test checks if the latency of the machine learning model is acceptable.

\textbf{Addresses}: F.ML.2

\textbf{Procedure}:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Write a program to record the timestamp for each processed frame received on the Raspberry Pi.
    \item Calculate the gaps between all consecutive frames.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Verification}: 
If all the calculated gaps are less or equal to one second, this test is passed.
