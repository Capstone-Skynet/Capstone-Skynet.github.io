\paragraph{T.DR.1: RPAS Maximum Takeoff Weight Test}

This test obtains the maximum thrust output, minimum thrust-to-weight ratio, and maximum power output of the RPAS prototype.

\textbf{Addresses}:  NF.DR.1, NF.DR.12, NF.DR.13

\textbf{Procedure}:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Attach the RPAS prototype to a scale or force sensor and ensure that the RPAS cannot separate scale or force sensor.
    \item Attach multimeter to the RPAS power circuitry.
    \item Fix or constrain the RPAS to the ground by using a heavy weight, tape, or fasteners.
    \item Tare the scale or force-sensor such that the measure is reference to the initial conditions.
    \item Power on the drone and arm the motors.
    \item Apply maximum throttle from the radio transmitter.
    \item Obtain voltage and current measurements from the multimeter.
    \item Obtain force measurements from the scale or force sensor.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Verification}: 
To ensure that the RPAS has minimum manuverability, at maximum take-off weight, we should be using 80\% throttle. For this test to pass, the RPAS must achieve a maximum pull of 125\% (2.5 kg) of maximum takeoff weight. Since this is a maximum load test case, we verify the measured current and voltage to ensure NF.DR.12 and NF.DR.13 are checked.
