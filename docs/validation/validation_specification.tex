\section{About This Document}

\subsection{Purpose}
This document serves to outline the methods, tests, and scenarios which are used to validate the project, and the status of these validation steps. 

\subsection{Intended Audience}
This document is intended for:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Quality Controllers (the Capstone team)}: to assess the validation methodology and results,
\item \textbf{Designers (the Capstone team)}: to assess the current degree of completion of the project,
\item \textbf{Client (and their representatives)}: to assess the final state of the project (when complete),
\item \textbf{and Legal Personnel:} to review the validation scheme if necessary. Such personnel may include personnel from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Industry Canada, and Transport Canada
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reading Guide}
This document organizes tests based on their component sub-systems, and whether the tests are automated or not (see Section \ref{auto} for a detailed description). Each section has a table which details the test, including a unique identifier, the requirement which it is testing, the test's status, and the last time the test was executed.

\section{Validation Overview}

\subsection{Automated and Manual Tests}\label{auto}
The validation tests employed (and this document) are split into two categories, \textit{automated tests} and \textit{manual tests}:

\textbf{Automated tests} are tests focused on tasks which are performed automatically and regularly by the device and \textit{can be monitored by the device itself}. Examples of such scenarios include self-testing systems on boot, monitoring communication status, machine learning accuracy logging, et cetera.

\textbf{Manual tests} are tests which \textit{cannot be performed by the device itself} and must be manually performed by a quality controller. These tests are performed less frequently --- some may be executed before every flight, while others may only be performed once. 

\subsection{Test Notation}
The following notations and conventions are used throughout test tables in this document:

\textbf{Verification Requirement (VR)}: The unique identifier of a specific test. These identifiers always start with \textbf{T}.

\textbf{Design Requirement (DR)}: Denotes the design requirement which the test is exercising, as listed in the project's \textit{Requirements Specification}. Requirement identifiers are encoded by their first characters, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{F}: Functional Requirement,
	\item \textbf{NF}: Non-Functional Requirement, and
	\item \textbf{C}: Constraint
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Status}: The status of a specific test:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{PEND} if the specific test has never been performed,
	\item \textbf{FAIL} if the specific test is failing, or
	\item \textbf{PASS} if the specific test is passing
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Effective Date}: Denotes the date at which the test was last performed (and thus, when the status was last updated). This field is not applicable for pending tests.

\textbf{It is important to note that a one-to-one mapping of VRs to DRs \textit{does not necessarily exist}}. Some requirements (particularly those which are high-level or functional) will have no tests, while some requirements will have multiple tests. It is also possible for one test to exercise multiple requirements at once.

\section{Manual Test Cases}

\subsection{Computing Platform Tests}
\subsubsection{General Tests}

\subsubsection{Camera Tests}
\subsubsection{Machine Learning Tests}
\subsubsection{Base Station Tests}
\subsubsection{Power Tests}

\textbf{Power usage test}
We will test the power usage of the Zedboard and Raspberry Pi by power them from the lab power supply and recording the current draw. This will help us confirm that our battery is appropirately sized and that our battery management system has a high enough current rating.

\textbf{Low power alarm test}
We will connect our battery monitor to the battery, connect voltage probes to the battery and then load our battery with an appropriately sized resistor in order to simulate normal operation. We will monitor the voltage of the battery and record at what voltage the low battery alarm goes off. This will ensure that our battery monitor is working correctly.

\textbf{Overvoltage and reverse polarity test}
We will connect our battery protection circuit to a lab power supply and load it with an approprately sized resistor in order to simulate normal operating conditions. We will then raise the supply voltage and probe the output voltage in order to verify that our overvoltage protection works correctly. We will then connect the supply voltage in backwards in order to verify that the reverse polarity protection works correctly.

\subsection{Multirotor Tests}

\textbf{VR}     & \textbf{DR}      & \textbf{Test Description}  	& \textbf{Status} & \textbf{Eff. Date} \\ \hline
T.DR.1 & NF.DR.1 & Attach a 2.0 kg mass to the multirotor RPAS (without payload) and verify that flight can be achieved. & PEND   & \\ \hline
T.DR.1 & NF.DR.2 & Weigh the multirotor RPAS (with payload) and verify that it is less than 25.0 kg. & PEND   & \\ \hline
