\section{About This Document}

\subsection{Purpose}
This document serves to outline the methods, tests, and scenarios which are used to validate the project, and the status of these validation steps. 

\subsection{Intended Audience}
This document is intended for:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Quality Controllers (the Capstone team)}: to assess the validation methodology and results,
\item \textbf{Designers (the Capstone team)}: to assess the current degree of completion of the project,
\item \textbf{Client (and their representatives)}: to assess the final state of the project (when complete),
\item \textbf{and Legal Personnel:} to review the validation scheme if necessary. Such personnel may include personnel from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Industry Canada, and Transport Canada
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reading Guide}
This document organizes tests based on their component sub-systems, and whether the tests are automated or not (see Section \ref{auto} for a detailed description). Each section has a table which details the test, including a unique identifier, the requirement which it is testing, the test's status, and the last time the test was executed.

\section{Validation Overview}

\subsection{Automated and Manual Tests}\label{auto}
The validation tests employed (and this document) are split into two categories, \textit{automated tests} and \textit{manual tests}:

\textbf{Automated tests} are tests focused on tasks which are performed automatically and regularly by the device and \textit{can be monitored by the device itself}. Examples of such scenarios include self-testing systems on boot, monitoring communication status, machine learning accuracy logging, et cetera.

\textbf{Manual tests} are tests which \textit{cannot be performed by the device itself} and must be manually performed by a quality controller. These tests are performed less frequently --- some may be executed before every flight, while others may only be performed once. 

\subsection{Test Notation}
The following notations and conventions are used throughout test tables in this document:

\textbf{Verification Requirement (VR)}: The unique identifier of a specific test. These identifiers always start with \textbf{T}.

\textbf{Design Requirement (DR)}: Denotes the design requirement which the test is exercising, as listed in the project's \textit{Requirements Specification}. Requirement identifiers are encoded by their first characters, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{F}: Functional Requirement,
	\item \textbf{NF}: Non-Functional Requirement, and
	\item \textbf{C}: Constraint
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Status}: The status of a specific test:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{PEND} if the specific test has never been performed,
	\item \textbf{FAIL} if the specific test is failing, or
	\item \textbf{PASS} if the specific test is passing
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Effective Date}: Denotes the date at which the test was last performed (and thus, when the status was last updated). This field is not applicable for pending tests.

\textbf{It is important to note that a one-to-one mapping of VRs to DRs \textit{does not necessarily exist}}. Some requirements (particularly those which are high-level or functional) will have no tests, while some requirements will have multiple tests. It is also possible for one test to exercise multiple requirements at once.
