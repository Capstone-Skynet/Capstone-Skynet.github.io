The proposed project is an examination of the feasibility of autonomous airborne
object tracking through integration of Machine Learning (ML) into field-programmable
gate arrays (FGPAs) on a independent mobile deployment vessel, such as a drone.
The ML implementation will focus on video processing for the object tracking component
of this project.

The grounds of the project is to expand on the application possibilites for ML. FPGAs
offer faster performance against conventional software and GPU applications, as well as
lower power consumption and the capbility of reconfiguration. This makes FPGAs desirable 
as an option for an autonomous computing platform. Implementing an FPGA for autonomous
object tracking on a drone can streamline many potential proccesses, such as disaster
response, wildlife management and demographic studies.
