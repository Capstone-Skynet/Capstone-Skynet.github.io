The proposed project is an examination of the feasibility of  deploy trained machine learning model on board using field-programmable gate arrays(FPGAs) to the drone.

The ML implementation will focus on video processing for the object tracking component of this project.

The ground of the project is to expand on the application and possibilities for ML. FPGAs can have higher performance against conventional software and GPU applications. FPGAs also have lower power consumption and the capability of reconfiguration. This makes FPGAs a great option for a mobile computing platform. Implementing an FPGA for autonomous object tracking on a drone can streamline many potential processes, such as disaster response, wildlife management and demographic studies.
