In late 2020, Dr. Lis will undertake a research project assessing the feasibility of converting software-based machine-learning models into efficient hardware designs through the use of High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools. Dr. Lis would like to obtain a drone-mounted, FPGA-based demonstration platform in order to demonstrate the mobility and applications of his research. 

In addition to the construction of demonstration platform, Dr. Lis would like an initial machine-learning application implemented on the device. This initial application will use a drone-mounted video camera to identify pedestrians through the use of machine learning, wirelessly transmitting the video and extracted pedestrian information to an external device (``base station''). Dr. Lis will use this developed application as a starting point for further modifications/improvements stemming from his research. Additionally, the application could be used for a wide variety of purposes as-is, including applications towards disaster response, wildlife management, and demographic studies.

The student team selected to undertake this project is comprised of five students in the Capstone program offered by the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia.
