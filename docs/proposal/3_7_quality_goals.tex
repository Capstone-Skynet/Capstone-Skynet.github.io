\subsubsection{Durability}
The mean time between failures of the product is more than 500 hours.

\subsubsection{Efficiency}
The power of the whole platform is reasonable to ensure at least 10 minus of flight time.

\subsubsection{Performance}
The throughput of the video processing unit is more than 30 frames per second.

\subsubsection{Accuracy}
The result from the machine learning model has an accuracy above 95\%.

\subsubsection{Availability}
The product can work up to 10 meters altitude under sunny, cloudy, and windy conditions.

\subsubsection{Completeness}
The final product is excepted to be able to perform the object detection on board. It should provide clear evidence on the feasibility of the concept of deploy the machine learning model on board using FPGA.
