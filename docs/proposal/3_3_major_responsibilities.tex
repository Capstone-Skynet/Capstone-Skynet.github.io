\subsubsection{Team Responsibilities}
The student team is responsible for the day-to-day development, management, and
operations of the project. The
team is responsible for the final delivery of all artifacts listed in Section
\ref{final_milestone}.
The team is additionally responsible for managing the project's finances/inventory,
and acquisition of key materials, electronics, and hardware.

The team is tentatively divided into a \textit{drone team} (consisting of Muchen, Arthur, and Ardell) and an \textit{FPGA team} (consisting of Peter and Wilson). This division of labour is only an initial approximation, and will likely change over time.

\subsubsection{Client Responsibilities}
The client is responsible for being available to meet in-person or online
given reasonable notice. They are additionally expected to provide necessary subject education/training materials upon request, and to provide additional financial support if needed (see Section \ref{budget} for
more details).
