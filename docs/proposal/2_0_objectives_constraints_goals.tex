This section elaborates the objectives to be pursued in the project, 
constraints that limit the project scope, 
and the goals to be achieved.

The definition that the student team will use will be as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Objectives}: Also referred sometimes as \textit{requirements}. 
    These are a list of \textit{yes-or-no} qualities that the student team 
    would like to achieve in order to consider the project as ``successful''.
    
    \item \textbf{Constraints}: The constraints are limiting factors that
    affect the variability of our success, and to what extent our goals
    can be achieved.

    \item \textbf{Goals}: Goals are quantitative specifications that would 
    be ideal to achieve; they are the target specification the student team
    is aiming for, but is not necessary for the project to be considered
    successful.

\end{itemize}
