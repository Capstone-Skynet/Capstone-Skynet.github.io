This section elaborates the objectives to be pursued in the project, 
constraints that limit the project's scope, 
and the goals to be achieved.

The precise usage of the terms used throughout this section are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Objectives}: Also referred sometimes as \textit{requirements}. 
    These are a list of \textit{yes-or-no} qualities that the student team 
    would like to achieve in order to consider the project as ``successful''.
    
    \item \textbf{Constraints}: The constraints are limiting factors that
    affect the variability of our success, and to what extent our goals
    can be achieved.

    \item \textbf{Goals}: Goals are quantitative specifications that would 
    be ideal to achieve; they are the target specification the student team
    is aiming for, but are not strictly necessary for the project to be deemed
    successful.

\end{itemize}
