The project will conclude on \textbf{April 3rd, 2020}, at which point the following project  deliverables will be provided to the project stakeholders (the Client and Instructors):

\begin{enumerate}
\item The drone prototype, a (unified) device which:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Captures video using an on-board camera,
\item utilizes FPGA-based neural network accelerators to processes the captured video using an FPGA (optionally with an embedded hard-processor) - computing the position of one or more (human) pedestrians in the captured video,
\item transmits the captured video and the associated pedestrian-location metadata to an external base-station,
\item and is mounted to a drone which is controlled remotely by a human and is capable of flying at least 5 minutes.
\end{enumerate}
\item The base-station prototype, a device which:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Receives the wirelessly transmitted video and the associated pedestrian-location metadata,
\item displays the video on a screen, overlaying the pedestrian metadata in the form of \textit{bounding boxes},
\item and stores the video for further research/analysis
\end{enumerate}
\item A technical dossier comprising of the following documents:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Requirements Specification} - Outlining the functional/non-functional requirements of the product
\item \textit{Design Specification} - Describing the high-level architecture and designs for technical subsystems
\item \textit{Validation Specification and Results} - Describing system test architectures and results
\item \textit{Operations, Maintenance, and Upgrades Specification} - Outlining FAQs, installation instructions, recommended maintenance, and troubleshooting steps
\item \textit{List of Deliverables}
\end{enumerate}
\item A video describing and demonstrating the product
\item A presentation and accompanying poster outlining the project
\item All source code and generated netlists
\end{enumerate}
