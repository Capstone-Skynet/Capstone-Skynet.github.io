    ANN & Artificial Neural Network, or simply ``Neural Network'', is a data processing model modeled after neuron interactions. The process consists of forward propagation using several matrix multiplications.\cite{ann}\\
    ASIC & Application-specific Integrated Circuits.\\
    CNN & Convolutional neural network are neural networks that is especially useful for image classification.\cite{cnn} \\
    ECE & Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia.\\
    FPGA & Field-Programmable-Gate-Arrays, ``programmable'' hardware that allows ASIC-like performance with software-like turn-around time and flexibility.\\
    GPU & Graphics Processing Unit, a discrete piece of hardware designed to accelerate graphic-intensive or other parallel computing tasks.\\
    LOS & Line-of-sight.\\
    ML & Machine learning.\\
    Multirotor & An unmanned vehicle with multiple engines. \\
    OTS & Off-the-shelf, or commercially available/purchasable \\
    PID / PID Controller & Proportion-Integral-Derivative controllers is the most common control algorithm for precise and accurate movement, as well as to compensate external forces.\cite{pid}\\
    RNN & Recurrent neural networks are neural networks where the output depends on previous computations, essentially consists of memory.\cite{rnn}\\
    RX & Receiver.\\
    TC & Transport Canada.\\
    TX & Transmitter.\\
    YOLO & You-Only-Look-Once is a fast ML algorithm that detect objects but is unlike CNN nor RNN.\cite{yolo}\cite{yolo-2}\\
