There are three project milestones to track project progress.
Milestones necessitate the delivery of in-progress documents listed
in Section \ref{document-artifacts}. Each milestone contains an oral
presentation which summarizes the project progress up to the milestone.

\subsubsection{Milestone I}
Milestone I (\textbf{October 15th, 2019}) necessitates the delivery of the
the \textit{Project Proposal} (\textit{this document}), outlining
the baseline agreement among all stakeholders with 
regards the project's administration and scope.

\subsubsection{Milestone II}
Milestone II (\textbf{November 25th, 2019}) is the first prototype review. 
The review features initial progress in camera interface
and machine learning accelerator implementations on the FPGA.
If the project progress is on track or ahead, the team will demonstrate a video-capture implementation synergizing with an onboard ML model. Otherwise, the team will
demonstrate these components functioning independently.

\subsubsection{Milestone III}
Milestone III (\textbf{February 10th, 2020}) is the second prototype review.
The review features improved ML accelerator and drone implementations. The team will
focus on effort invested into video transmission and power supply circuitry.
