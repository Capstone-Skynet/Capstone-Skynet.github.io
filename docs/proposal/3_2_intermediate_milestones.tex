There are three project milestones to track the project progress,
Milestones necessitate the delivery in-progress documents listed
in section \ref{document-artifacts}. Each milestone contains a oral
presentation which summarizes the project progress up to the milestone.

\subsubsection{Milestone I}
Milestone I (\textbf{October 15th, 2019}) requires the production of a
Project Proposal (\textit{this document}), which outlines the baseline
agreement among all stakeholders with regards to what is to be accomplished. 

\subsubsection{Milestone II}
Milestone II (\textbf{November 25th, 2019}), the first prototype review,
will outline our initial progress in implementing both video capture and
neural accelerator circuitry on our selected FPGA platform. Depending on
our progress, we will either demonstrate each of these components separately
(i.e. displaying captured video on a screen whileprocessing an unrelated
ML task) or, preferably, demonstrate these components in a unified fashion
(i.e. display captured video and process it to some extent using our ML
infrastructure). 

\subsubsection{Milestone III}
Milestone III (\textbf{February 10th, 2020}), the second prototype review,
will demonstrate our continued progress in improving our video capture/neural
accelerator, in addition to presenting our initial platform-mobility
implementations: especially focusing on our video transmission and power
supply circuitry (including battery packs).
