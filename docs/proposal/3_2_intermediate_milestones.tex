There are three project milestones to track the project progress,
Milestones necessitate the delivery in-progress documents listed
in section \ref{document-artifacts}. Each milestone contains an oral
presentation which summarizes the project progress up to the milestone.

\subsubsection{Milestone I}
By milestone I (\textbf{October 15th, 2019}), the team finishes and submits
the \textit{Project Proposal} (\textit{this document}). The document outlines
the [baseline agreement among all stakeholders with 
regards to what is to be accomplished.]FIXME

\subsubsection{Milestone II}
Milestone II (\textbf{November 25th, 2019}) is the first prototype review. 
The review features initial progress in camera interface
and machine learning accelerator implementations on the FPGAs.
If the project progress is on track or ahead, we will demonstrate video-
capturing implementation synergizing with onboard ML model. Otherwise, we will
demonstrate these components functioning independently.

\subsubsection{Milestone III}
Milestone III (\textbf{February 10th, 2020}) is the second prototype review.
The review features improved ML accelerator and drone implementations. We will
focus on effort invested into video transmission, power supply circuitry, 
and batteries.
