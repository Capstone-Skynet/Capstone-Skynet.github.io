\subsubsection{Risk Management}
Risks can have big influences on the whole project. It is important that we have an effective protocol to handle the potential risks.

The team has generated a list of potential risks\footnote{see section 4.7.2} and assign the likelihood and impact value to each of them according to the purpose and objective of the project. If the risk number, which is the product of likelihood and impact, of a risk is higher than 0.4, then it has a specific post-risk protocol. All the risks will be monitored and if there exits any signal of a risk, corresponding operations will be performed to prevent it from happening.

When a team member notices any signs of a risk, he will send a message to slack channel and add one card on Trello, the project management tool that the team is using, to alert the whole team. The card on Trello board will have a label showing the significance of the risk and the whole team will discuss about the operations that need to be performed.

The risk profile will be updated whenever the situation is changed, i.e. new potential risks emerged.
