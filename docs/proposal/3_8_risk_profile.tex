\subsubsection{Risk Management}
The student team has generated a list of potential risks which threaten the viability of the project and have assigned a likelihood and impact value to each of them (Table \ref{riskprofile}). The \textit{risk index} for each risk is the product of these two values: \textit{likelihood} and \textit{impact}.

\textit{To mitigate the outlined risks, the following risk management protocol is followed:}


If the risk index is \textbf{greater or equal to 0.4}, then the risk mitigation protocol \textit{must} be followed. This entails creating a card for the specific risk on Trello (the team's project management tool), discussing the status of the risk during the weekly group meeting, and providing immediate updates to the status of the risk on Slack as they occur.

If the risk index is \textbf{less than 0.4}, then the above risk mitigation protocol \textit{may} be followed, if deemed necessary. Otherwise, the risk is simply monitored for updates.

The risk profile is updated/reviewed weekly (during the team meeting) and as otherwise necessary.
