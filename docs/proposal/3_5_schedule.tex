The tentative timeline of the project is detailed in Figure \ref{fig:timeline}. Specific deliverables and goals for each milestone are detailed in sections \ref{final_milestone} and \ref{intermediate_milestone}.

\subsubsection{Weekly Schedule}

All team members have agreed to reserve the following time slots for group/client meetings, presentation preparations, and general developmental work:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tuesday, 15:00 - 17:30
\item Thursday, 15:00 - 17:30
\item Friday, 8:00 - 10:00
\end{itemize}

The team members also acknowledge that significant amounts of development effort will fall outside of these designated periods.

Team meetings are scheduled for Tuesdays at 15:30 in the Macleod Building, and meetings with the instructional team are currently scheduled for Thursdays at 16:00 in the Irving K. Barber Learning Centre. Meetings with the instructional team will transition to 15:30 on Tuesdays beginning in Term 2.

Formal client meetings will be held on an irregular (roughly weekly) basis, dependent on the client's availability. Peter Deutsch, the principal point of contact for the client, will provide additional project updates as needed via email, Skype, or informal in-person discussions.
