The objectives are:


Main objectives:

- ML implementation on FPGA
    - Video interception and processing on FPGA device
    - Adequate datapath and or (hard/soft)core processor to aid
      or facilitate fast and well-integrated data flow
    - Adequate integration of a suited machine learning, specifically
      computer vision, model on the FPGA such as CNN, RNN, or YOLO.
    - Video can be processed in real time with help of reduced
      frame rates and or resolution

- Integration of hardware on drone
    - The total package of the hardware impose viablility of such concept by
      being compact and easily deployable
    - Electronics power draw is not ridiculous
    - Electronics power output (heat) is not ridiculous

- Transmission of video to ground station
    - A separate video signal is streamed to the ground station along with
      the processed data, or, the video stream is being overlayed with
      machine learning data and is both transmitted to the ground station
    - Can receive video signal wirelessly
    - Does not need to be on the FPGA
