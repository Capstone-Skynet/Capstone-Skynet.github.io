The main objectives have been separated into three categories.

\textbf{Machine Learning Implementation on the FPGA}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The FPGA and its connected hardware receives usable video data.
  \item Adequately implemented datapath and or processor to facilitate data-flow.
  \item Adequately implemented machine learning model such as CNN, RNN, or YOLO in hardware.
  \item Video can be processed in real time with help of reduced frame rates and or resolution.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Integration of Electronics with the Drone}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The total package of the electronics and hardware (that is, equipment
  used to gather, process, and transmit video data) is reasonably compact 
  and deployable on a drone.
  \item Total power draw is reasonable.
  \item Total power output (heat) is reasonable.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Video Transmission to Ground Station}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Video stream is able to be received from the ground station along 
        with processed ML data.
  \item Transmission in the chosen frequency bands is legal (no further actions
        required if 2.4GHz or 5.2Ghz is used).
\end{itemize}
