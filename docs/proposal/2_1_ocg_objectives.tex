The main objectives are sorted by the client's priority in descending order.

\textbf{Integration of Electronics with the Drone}:
Since the ultimate deliverable consists of a highly mobile computing platform,
our uttermost most important objective is a successful integration of computation and processing hardware with the drone.
The equipment for capturing vidoe data, perform processing, and trasmitting digital data should be reasonbly compact and easily deployable.
the total power draw from the drone as well as power output, in terms of thermal output, should be reasonable such that they affect minimally
on the flight characteristics of the drone.

\textbf{Air-to-Ground Data Transmission}:
Critical to research and analytics, we need to ensure the drone payload is able to transmit video sensor data, as well as the processed data
from the onboard hardware accelerator (FPGA). There is a ground station, consist of a receiver and a display device such as a mobile phone or 
computer receives and decode the transmission for display, providing the client or user with real-time video stream and machine learning intents.
The wireless frequency and band chosen is compliant with local laws; no further actions are required if we utilize WiFi protocol (802.11n/ac in 2.4GHz or 5.2GHz)
using off-the-shelf WiFi modules.

\textbf{Machine Learning Implementation on the FPGA}:




\begin{itemize}
  \item The FPGA and its connected hardware receives usable video data.
  \item Adequately implemented datapath and or processor to facilitate data-flow.
  \item Adequately implemented machine learning model such as CNN, RNN, or YOLO in hardware.
  \item Video can be processed in real time with help of reduced frame rates and or resolution.
\end{itemize}
