The main goal is by the end of the project, have a working implementation
of a ML computer vision model, capable of object detection and spacial
object tracking implemented on a commercial FPGA. The number of logic elements 
required to implement video processing, video transmission, and other
data tasks are within the hardware limit allowed by the budget.
The implementation is capable of being mounted on a drone and perform ML
tasks continuously and autonomously. Both the unprocessed (raw) and processed
data are to be transmitted wirelessly using 2.4GHz WiFi to a ground station, 
which could be a laptop computer, or a mobile phone. The transmitted video
data should have reasonable quality of at least 640x480 resolution and at 
a reasonable frame rate -- at least 10 fps. The total take-off weight of the
drone along with the processing hardware should not exceed 25 kilograms
(as specified by Transport Canada, a pilot with \textit{Basic Operations}
certificate or \textit{Advanced Operations} certificate cannot operate a 
drone heavier than 25kg). Lastly, the flight time of the drone is at least 
1 minute and can fly to an altitude of at least +10m to prove the viability
of the concept explored in this project.
