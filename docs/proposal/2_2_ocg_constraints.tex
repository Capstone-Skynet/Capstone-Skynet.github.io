In pursuit of the objectives listed above, the main constraints relating 
each main objective is as follows:

FPGA ML:

- The FPGA is a highly adaptive device that can deliver almost-ASIC level speed
but a large number of logic elements are required to implement a large model 
such as a machine learning - computer vision - model. The inherit constraints
with FPGA RTL designs such as timing, area, and power constraints will ultimately
limit the processing throughput of the video data. Bottleneck for limiting
processing resolution and frequency (frame rate).

- Common machine learning models for computer vision is designed for GPU to
maximize parallel computing. The FPGA cannot match GPU data throughput, thus
the limited amount of logic elements would also constrain our architecture
design.
