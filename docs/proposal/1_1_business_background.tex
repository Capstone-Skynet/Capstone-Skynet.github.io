The client of this project is Professor Mieszko Lis, a professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of British Columbia (UBC). A particular research focus of Dr. Lis is the acceleration of (traditionally software-based) machine-learning (ML) models through the use of dedicated hardware. 

The fabrication of custom-designed hardware is often prohibitively expensive --- the manufacture of application-specific integrated controllers (ASICs) can easily cost millions of dollars and take several years to complete. This is inherently unconducive to the quick and iterative prototyping required by small-scale research projects like those run by Dr. Lis. To mitigate this constraint, Dr. Lis would like to use Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to prototype his ML hardware designs. FPGAs are effectively programmable analogs of ASICs -- trading off maximal circuit complexity and performance with a near-instant implementation time (a design can be implemented on an FPGA in a manner of minutes to hours) --- facilitating the rapid turnaround time required by Dr. Lis. Once a finalized design has emerged from the prototyping process performed on the FPGA, the design can then be converted and implemented on an actual integrated controller, if desired.
