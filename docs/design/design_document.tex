\section{About This Document}
\subsection{Purpose}
This document serves to provide a concise description of the primary design decisions made throughout the Multirotor Computing Platform project. In addition to providing a high-level overview of the system architecture, this design specification provides specific rationale for the design of each of the project's various subsystems. This document also outlines potential improvements to subsystems which were envisioned, but not implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

\subsection{Intended Audience}
This document is intended for the:
\begin{itemize}
\item Project Designers and Quality Controllers (the Capstone team),
\item Client (and their representatives),
\item External Project Sponsors,
\item and Legal Personnel (The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Industry Canada, Transport Canada)
\end{itemize}

This document is particularly relevant to those who may modify, extend, improve, or interface with the system, in addition to those who will assess the product's design against academic, organizational, and/or legal criteria.

\subsection{Reading Guide}

This document begins with a high-level decomposition of the product into its two major components: the \textit{Computing Platform} and the \textit{Multirotor}. It then conveys the technical decisions made for the subsystems of each component, providing detailed rationale as to why they represent the best solution given the project's requirements and constraints (as detailed in the \textit{Requirements Document}). Cross-references to the \textit{Requirements Document} are denoted in \textbf{bold}.

It is useful to note that the \textit{Computing Platform} subsections (beginning in Section \ref{computing_platform}) are ordered by their stage in the device's data flow -- video capture is discussed first, then processing, and finally data conveyance to the user.
