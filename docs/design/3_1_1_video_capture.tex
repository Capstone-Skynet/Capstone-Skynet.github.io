\subsubsection{Subsystem Overview}
The video capture subsystem of the computing platform consists of a camera and the video transmission protocol to the processing core. For this subsystem, the hardware utilized includes a CMOS camera, a Raspberry Pi device, and a MIPI Camera Serial interface. 

\subsubsection{Camera Choice}
The camera used to capture video is the \textit{Raspberry Pi Camera Module}. This module supports 1080p, 720p and 480p video, captured using a fixed focus lens. The camera captures live video and sends it to the PMB, which feeds the data to both the machine learning model and the base station.

A major consideration regarding camera selection was the latency and throughput of the machine learning implementation on the FPGA. As the machine learning implementation is heavily constrained by the FPGA's limited resources, it is not necessary to use a camera with a high resolution and framerate.

% {MIPI interface}
\subsubsection{MIPI Interface and Libraries}
The MIPI camera serial interface (CSI) is a high-speed protocol primarily intended for point-to-point image and video transmission between cameras and host devices. 

The MIPI protocol has been widely adopted for image and video transmission, and as such the camera can easily be replaced by the client in the future, if desired (fulfilling constraint \textbf{C.EX.5}).

% {Camera libraries or getting the video to a 'viewable' state}
The \texttt{raspicam} C++ library manages video acquisition from the camera module. The program uses \texttt{raspicam} instead of the native Raspberry Pi camera libraries in order to perform capture and processing in a low-level C++ environment. This allows for the low-level memory manipulation/image format conversions required throughout the flow to be performed directly on the (more powerful) PMB, rather than the PLB.

% {Explored Alternatives}
\subsubsection{Explored Hardware Alternatives}
There were many alternatives explored for each component of the video capture subsystem.

One of the possibilities explored for the camera subsystem was the purchase of a drone package with a pre-integrated camera. The implicit requirement to disassemble and reconfigure/tap-into a hard-wired system, however, would create an unmaintainable product -- making user replacement of the camera for future research improvements difficult (violating constraint \textbf{C.EX.5}).

Another consideration for the subsystem involved utilizing a USB webcam -- connecting it via the Raspberry Pi's USB port. The issue with this option is the inferior configurability of the webcam compared to the Raspberry Pi camera. The reconfigurability provided by the \texttt{raspicam} library, as previously noted, made the Rasberry Pi Camera a better solution suited to the client's needs.

A possible alternative explored for the camera interface was RS-232. The RS-232 interface is a commonly used, easy to integrate serial interface. It is widely used in the communications area, however its low data transfer rate limits both the resolution and frame rate of the video footage that can be captured. The highest (reliable) baud rate of the RS-232 interface is approximately 115200 bits per second -- translating to a frame rate of 0.05 fps for 480p video footage (violating constraint \textbf{NF.CM.3}).

For the live video feed transmission, other options explored included wireless HDMI, VGA and analog transmission methods.  Ultimately these options required additional hardware (contributing to higher costs and system weight) and would introduce more points of failure and complexity into the finalized system, thus they were not pursued.
