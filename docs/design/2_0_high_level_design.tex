TODO: High Level Diagram of \textit{all} components (no need for interfaces here)

The Computing Platform, mounted on the multirotor, is comprised of two distinct processing platforms: the \textit{Platform Management Board} and the \textit{Programmable Logic Board}. The \textit{Platform Management Board} hosts the software and interfaces required to interface with both the Programmable Logic Board (also present on the multirotor) and the Base Station.
