The Computing Platform, mounted on the multirotor, is comprised of two distinct processing platforms: the \textit{Platform Management Board} (PMB) and the \textit{Programmable Logic Board} (PLB). The PMB hosts the software and interfaces required to interface with both the PMB (also present on the multirotor) and the base station.
