    ANN & Artificial Neural Network, or simply ``Neural Network'', is a data processing model modeled after neuron interactions. The process consists of forward propagation through the use of several matrix multiplications.\cite{ann}\\
    ASIC & Application-Specific Integrated Circuit.\\
    CNN & Convolutional Neural Networks are neural networks which are especially useful for image classification.\cite{cnn} \\
    ECE & Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia.\\
    FPGA & Field-Programmable-Gate-Array, a ``programmable'' hardware unit that allows for ASIC-like performance with software-like turn-around time and flexibility.\\
    FPS & Frames Per Second.\\
    GPU & Graphics Processing Unit, a discrete piece of hardware designed to accelerate graphics-intensive or other parallel computing tasks.\\
	ICICS & Institute for Computing, Information, and Cognitive Systems at the University of British Columbia.\\
    LOS & Line-of-sight.\\
    ML & Machine Learning.\\
    Multirotor & An unmanned vehicle with multiple engines. \\
    OTS & Off-the-shelf, or commercially available/purchasable. \\
    PID / PID Controller & Proportion-Integral-Derivative controllers denote the most common control algorithm for precise and accurate movement in multirotor applications.\cite{pid}\\
    RNN & Recurrent Neural Networks are neural networks where the output depends on previous computations, effectively consisting of memory.\cite{rnn}\\
    RX & Receiver.\\
    TC & Transport Canada.\\
    TX & Transmitter.\\
    YOLO & You-Only-Look-Once is a fast ML algorithm which detect objects, but is unlike CNN or RNN.\cite{yolo}\cite{yolo-2}\\
     & \\
