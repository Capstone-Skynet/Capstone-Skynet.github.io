\subsection{Purpose}\label{section:about:purpose}
This document outlines expected metrics related to the performance, quality, longevity, environmental impact, cost, legality, and safety of the Multirotor Computing Platform project. It is intended to convey \textit{what the product does} and \textit{how well it performs}, rather than describing the actual project implementation (as described in the \textit{Design Document}).

\subsection{Intended Audiences}\label{section:about:audience}
This document is intended for \textit{all project stakeholders}, including (but not limited to):
\begin{itemize}
\item Project Designers and Quality Controllers (the Capstone team), 
\item Client (and their representatives), 
\item External Project Sponsors, and
\item Legal Personnel (The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Industry Canada, and Transport Canada)
\end{itemize}

This document is particularly relevant to those who need to understand the project's scope, validate the product, and/or assess the product against academic or organizational objectives.

\subsection{Reading Guide}\label{section:about:readingguide}
This document contains both a high-level description of the project, in addition to detailed requirements broken down as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Functional Requirements}; which describe the services, capabilities, and functions delivered by the product, 
\item \textbf{Non-Functional Requirements}; which describe the quality attributes the product needs to exhibit, and  
\item \textbf{Constraints}; which describe restrictions regarding how the product may be implemented.
\end{itemize}

Each detailed requirement listed in this document is assigned a unique \textit{requirement identifier}, which can be cross-referenced to other project documents (mainly the \textit{Design Document} and \textit{Validation Specification}). 

For specific details regarding the project's implementation, refer to the \textit{Design Document}.

For a description of how these requirements are tested, refer to the \textit{Validation Specification}.

\section{Background}

This project aims to offer an aerial/drone platform which provides both video acquisition and supplemental programmable hardware processing capabilities on-board -- customizable to a wide range of video applications which require hardware acceleration. The project's client, Dr. Mieszko Lis, intends to utilize this device as a platform to showcase his ongoing hardware-accelerated machine learning research projects. Potential applications of this research may include pedestrian detection, wildlife management, and other object-detection tasks.

\label{hlpic}
\end{figure}

The final product consists of a \textit{multirotor-mounted computing platform} and a \textit{mobile base/ground station}. The former component collects, processes, and analyzes aerial video; and the latter displays the live video feed from the multirotor, overlaying the computing platform's analysis results. The on-board FPGA performs hardware acceleration as part of the video analysis.

Current products on the market are primarily aimed at consumers and ``prosumers'' --- content-producers whose main focus is aerial photography. While our project also features aerial photography, we emphasize providing real-time analytics using the captured video, in addition to supplying custom features and modifications tailored to our client.

The project is classified as an integration of consumer electronics with components intended to be used in research and industry. In particular,  sub-domains of this project consist of FPGA design, hardware acceleration, machine learning (ML), video acquisition, data transmission, power systems, and electric propulsion systems.
