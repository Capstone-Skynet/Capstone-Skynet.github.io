\section{About This Document}\label{section:about}
\subsection{Purpose}\label{section:about:purpose}
This document outlines expected metrics related to performance, quality, longevity, environmental impact, cost, legality, and safety of the Multirotor Computing Platform project.

\subsection{Intended Audiences}\label{section:about:audience}
This document is intended for \textit{all project stakeholders}, including (but not limited to):
\begin{itemize}
\item Project Designers and Quality Controllers (the Capstone team)
\item Client (and their representatives)
\item External Project Sponsors
\item Legal Personnel (The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Industry Canada, Transport Canada)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reading Guide}\label{section:about:readingguide}
This document describes both a high-level description of the project, in addition to detailed functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and constraints. Each detailed requirement listed in this document is assigned a unique \textit{requirement identifier}, which can be cross-referenced to other project documents (mainly the Design Specification). 

\section{Background}

% 
% Describes the importance of a flying FPGA ML thing to the client (Mieszko).
% 

TODO: A nice high-level pictogram (\textit{not} a block diagram, that's for the design doc) would be great here.

\section{Domain}

The project is classified as an integration of consumer electronics with components intended to be used in research and industry. In particular, specific sub-domains of this project include FPGA design, hardware acceleration, machine learning, and video acquisition/transmission. 

\section{Goal}

This project aims to offer am aerial/drone platform which provides both video acquisition and supplemental programmable hardware processing capabilities on-board -- customizable to a wide range of video applications that require hardware acceleration. Current products on the market are primarily aimed at the consumers and ``prosumers'' -- content-producers whose main focus in aerial photography/videography. While our project also features aerial photography, its emphasis is in performing real-time analytics using the captured video, in addition to supplying custom features and modifications tailored to our client.
