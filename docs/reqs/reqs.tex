\section{About This Document}\label{section:about}
\subsection{Purpose}\label{section:about:purpose}
This document outlines the project's requirements, laying out a basis of what is required for the project to be deemed \textit{successful}. In particular, this document outlines expected metrics related to performance, quality/longevity, environmental impact, cost, legality, and safety.

\subsection{Intended Audiences}\label{section:about:audience}
This document is intended for \textit{all project stakeholders}, including (but not limited to):
\begin{itemize}
\item Project Designers and Quality Controllers (the Capstone team)
\item Client (and their representatives)
\item External Project Sponsors
\item Legal Personnel (The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Industry Canada, Transport Canada)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reading Guide}\label{section:about:readingguide}
This document describes both a high-level description of the project, in addition to detailed functional/non-functional requirements. Each detailed requirement listed in this document is assigned a unique \textit{requirement identifier}, which can be cross-referenced to other project documents (mainly the Design Specification). 

\section{Background}

% 
% Describes the importance of a flying FPGA ML thing to the client (Mieszko).
% 

TODO: A nice high-level pictogram (\textit{not} a block diagram, that's for the design doc) would be great here.

\section{Domain}

The project is classified as consumer electronics integrated with components used in research and industry such as FPGA hardware accelerators. 

\section{Goal}

This project is different than other products on the market as we offer programmable hardware that could be taylored to a wide range of applications that require hardware acceleration, prodominately machine learning models. Popular products on the market are mostly aimed at the consumers and ``prosumers'' or content-producers with a main focus in aerial photography. While our project also features aerial photography, the emphasis is in performing real-time analytics using the captured video as well as custom features and modifications taylored to our client.

\section{Functional Requirements}\label{section:funcreq}
