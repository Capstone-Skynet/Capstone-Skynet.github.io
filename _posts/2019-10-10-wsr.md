## Meeting with Client

*Everyone*

First “proper” meeting with the client (face-to-face).

<!-- excerpt -->

- Meet the team
- Confirmed requirements established last week
- Re-prioritized the key requirements:
  - No longer is machine learning and object detection the main objective
  - The main objective is system integration of a FPGA *computing platform* on the drone.
  - The new priority is:
    1. FPGA integrated on a drone
    2. Data transmission and ground station
    3. (not as important anymore) Machine learning model to detect objects (since FPGA is programmable, a newer and more efficient model could always be uploaded in the future).
- Consolidated on budget
  - Budget is flexible through research funding
  - Spreadsheets and purchasing options are to be presented to the client before approval
- Established expectations from both the student team (us) and the client.



## Risk Management

*Everyone*

After meeting with the client, we are currently reevaluating the risks and severity using the new priority set by the client.



## Project Proposal

*Everyone*

- See Trello for division of labor
- We have a working draft right now but we still have some problems that require clarification
  - Approval page?
  - Quality of goal sections vs. OCG section?
  - High level tasks section?
- Other feedback from the initial draft?
