### Project Scope

- Spoke with Mieszko to further solidify project requirements
  - Mieszko has stated that a drone is still of high importance to him
    - Drone licensing is considerably more difficult than originally anticipated, requiring an exam which would take weeks to study for.
    - Mieszko has indicated that he would be comfortable taking the test in the future, if necessary.
    - Drone licensing is _not_ required if we fly inside, so we will target indoor use cases for now (Mieszko may integrate outdoor flight in the future).

### FPGA/ML Platform Status

- Broke down FPGA selection into three options:
  1. Department-provided Zynq FPGA ($0): Mieszko has provided a (reasonably light) board which will need an expansion board for video, but is otherwise fairly capable.
  2. Nexys Video Artix-7 FPGA (~$500): An FPGA platform which has more powerful video capture/processing capabilities.
  3. Microsemi PolarFire FPGA kit (~$1500): An all-in-one solution which has a camera integrated, and exhibits considerable power savings.

### Drone Status

- Muchen has developed a parts list for a drone capable of lifting approximately 1-2 kg for roughly 20 minutes, costing ~$300.
  - He will further experiment with lift/load calculations using his personal drone.
