### Camera

 *Peter, Wilson*

- Researched utilization of Camera x DE1-SoC from student project (CPEN 391).
- From reading through documentation and speaking with instructor, the video throughput is inadequate for demo purposes.
- Peter will consult with masters students in the FPGA group to see what cameras they've used in the past.

### Parts List and Purchasing

*Muchen, Arthur*

- Preliminary parts list for drone construction underway.
- Meeting with client next week to get more requirements in detail so that we make better decision with specs, parts, etc.

### UAS

*Ardell*

- Continued exchange with the UAS/drone team --- they have not been very responsive.

### Risks

Unchanged from last week.
