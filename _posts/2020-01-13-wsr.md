## Drone

### Constraint Update

- We had to go with a bigger deisgn
- Limited flight time

### Ordering

- We have an order from eBay
- Parts list (and the parts document)

<!-- excerpt -->

### Frame customization

- Frame is a bit heavy (680 g) but there are certain parts that we can replace
- We will CAD the mounts for the CP.

## Zedboard / ML

### FreeTPU

FreeTPU is a hardware accelerator for machine learning that fits on to the ZedBoard FPGA.
Comes with API, we can look into customizing it for our purposes.
For YOLO V3 has a inference time of 0.2 s (in theory frame-to-frame time).

Justifcation design:
- Why FreeTPU?

Risk: 
- Still uncertain about the overhead between opertions.
- Compilation on FreeTPU presents constraints on **where** we can compile. The API should be compiled on a ARM chip device (Zedboard or Pi). 

### Flight Mode

Risks:
- currently both the PLB and PMB boots linux but require after-boot commands, we need to figure out how to execute them automatically upon power on
- an indication that the computing sytem is good to go. As a constrain, there is no way to tell the FC that the CP is flight-ready.

## Base Station GUI program

Arthur made a prototype in C#.

Risk: there is a fragmentation of code base that could restrict teammates' ability to be agile.

Proposed mitigation: a standard protocol for program interfaces. As long as we have a solid protocol, any team member have the freedom to experiment with whicherver language they like.
