## Heading 2

This is a testing post. The document is written in Markdown and then statically generated into HTMl using Jekyll.

In the front matter (stuff surrounded by `---`), add the line `use_math: true` to enable MathJax in webpages to render LaTeX math.

## Another Heading 2

All Markdown syntax is supported. Including code blocks:

```python

def foo(do, da):
    print(f'{do} bar {da}')
    return do + da
```

> And block quotes
