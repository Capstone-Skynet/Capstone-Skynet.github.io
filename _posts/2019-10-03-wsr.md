## FPGA Gate Count Estimate

*Peter Deutsch*

- A rough estimate has been made for the number of logic modules required to compile TensorFlow model onto an FPGA.
- Lower bound is acceptable but difficult to achieve.
- Upper bound is way to high.



## Research

*Everyone*

- Reading into LeFlow paper: compiling TensorFlow (Python) model into synthesizable Verilog.
  - Not very efficient.
  - General consensus is that we don’t pursue this option unless our ML model is extremely good but difficult to implement as hardware.
- Optimization of Convolutional Neural Nets (CNN) on FPGA.
  - Unique architecture and timing and achieves fastest FPGA performance for a neural net ~60GFLOPs for 100MHz clock.
  - A bit too ambitious (for now).



## Risk Management

*Everyone*

| Risk                                                         | Likelihood | Impact | Risk |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------ | ---- |
| FPGA logic capacity is not enough to implement our solution. | 0.5        | 1      | 0.5  |
| Accidents that damage to drone and FPGA that leads to extra budget that we may not   have. | 0.7        | 0.7    | 0.49 |
| Forced to buy cheaper components which leads to lower performance. | 0.8        | 0.5    | 0.4  |
| Deliveries is not meeting client’s expectations              | 0.2        | 0.8    | 0.4  |
| Knowledge and skill (Machine Learning & Computer vision) required for project is   not sufficient. | 0.5        | 0.8    | 0.4  |
| Our scrum method is not efficient                            | 0.5        | 0.7    | 0.35 |
| Scope of the project is underestimated which leads to burn outs | 0.5        | 0.7    | 0.35 |
| Not have enough money.                                       | 0.5        | 0.7    | 0.35 |
| Not enough time commitment from team member due to other courses. | 0.5        | 0.6    | 0.3  |
| Team is indecisive which leads to delay - management is not good enough to make a   timely decision. | 0.4        | 0.7    | 0.28 |



## Project Proposal

*Everyone*

- See Trello for division of labor
- Draft before next Tuesday (first review and revision with the client).
- Second draft before next Thursday (second review and revision with instructors).
